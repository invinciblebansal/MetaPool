2.Voter's Authentication : It is assured by the Facial recognition system made using Convolutional Neural Networks .
500 Live Images of voters are recorded at the time of registration and used for training our model.

3. Accessibility : The most important advantage of MetaPool is its reach in every corner of the world just with your smartphones.It aims to achieve 100% vote count in country by providing a very convenient way to cast their vote.

4. Voter's Anonymity : We take care of our voter's data well by creating a special code for every voter at time of casting with which the node created will be attached to the canditate chain. This result in a secured data achievement and ananymity too.
